# Heart-disease-prediction-using-SVM

#### About the Data:
Heart diseases, also known as [Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease), are the first cause of death worldwide, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year which is about 32% of all deaths all over the world. 

In this Project, we implemented Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm that determines which patient is in danger and which is not.

For this perpose, we used `Heart_Disease_Dataset.csv` dataset.
